                    SportsBuzz11 may use a third-party service provider(s) and/or the official website of the match
                    organizer to get score feed and other information that is required for the calculation of the
                    fantasy points. In case, if any, there is an error in the calculation of fantasy points, selection
                    of winners etc., due to the inaccurate feed provided by the third-party service provider(s),

                    before any officer/organization/tribunal/forum.
